# Prospector
“PROSPECTOR is an android mobile application project. It uses  NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) Service ,"Each day a different image or photograph of our universe is featured, along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer.” The photograph does not necessarily correspond to a celestial event on the exact day that it is displayed, and images are sometimes repeated. However, the pictures and descriptions often relate to current events in astronomy and space exploration. The user can see all photographs. This application facilitates the user to set the Astronomy picture of the day as the Home Screen Wallpaper + Lock screen Wallpaper.
